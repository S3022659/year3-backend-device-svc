# Notes:
# - Create two repository secrets before running this workflow:
#   1) AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_NAME      -> the name of your Function App in Azure
#   2) AZURE_FUNCTIONAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE -> the publish profile XML (from Azure portal)
# - This workflow builds the project with `npm run build` (which runs `tsc`) then deploys the repository contents.
# - If your built JS files live in `dist/` and the function app expects only compiled output, you can set `package: 'dist'` above instead of '.'.
